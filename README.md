# A Docker Development Environment For WordPress

For wp-cli, here's the alias I use so I don't have to write `docker-compose run --rm wpcli <command>`:

`alias wp="docker-compose run --rm wpcli"`

Add the above to your .bashrc or .bash_profile or .zshrc, maybe .profile. All depends on how you run shell or the system you are running.
